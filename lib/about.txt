This folder shall contain projects which are not directly referencing any of the script specific API's.

These project can be used by compilers as managed .net assemblies and by user applications as translateable script assemblies.

For historic reasons the following projects started out in /core directory.
ScriptCoreLib.Archive.ZIP.dll
ScriptCoreLib.Maze.dll
ScriptCoreLib.Reflection.Options.dll
ScriptCoreLib.YAML.dll

The jsc solution should install such libraries under jsc/lib where as compiler and core components still go under jsc/bin.
