This assembly is derived from:

http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/flash/reference.html
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/flash/intro.html#SWC_File

This assembly only defines native types within 'map_1_9a.swc'.

In the future there should be a tool to create this 'Introp Assembly' automatically.
