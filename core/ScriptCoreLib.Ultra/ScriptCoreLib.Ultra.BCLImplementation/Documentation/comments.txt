This assembly contains implementations for types from Global Assembly Cache.

All types within this assembly shall be internal.

The types defined here cannot be used by 
	[1] ScriptCoreLib or 
	[2] ScriptCoreLibJava or 
	[3] assemblies with [Obfuscation(Feature = "script")] yet.

Such types can be defined at ScriptCoreLib.Shared namespace.

Example: global::Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction
	MsgBox is UI related. For JavaScript we can use alert.
	We cannot bring that type to this cross platform library.

Note: While adding types here one must carefully consdier if the dependancies are available for each intended platform.
