support of emitting default values (basically zeros) for sbyte, float, long, ulong, etc (though for real long support we need struct with 2 integer fields, but emit zeros is better than fail)
 generally, emit floats as doubles (this barely affects semantics)
 emit arrays of booleans
 (i've implemented this by myself adapting code from other data types and it seems to work)
 and emit unsigned comparisons, too (just add _Un, _Un_S opcodes to the list)
 dunno about _ovf family, better leave them out by now
