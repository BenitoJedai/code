\section{Intro}

In 2011 I took a course. It was the \textbf{Advanced Topics in Biomechanics} course by \textbf{Adriano Cavalcanti, Ph.D}. During this course we had to come up with various 3D visualizations of different models. I chose to do that within WebGL. As a final task we had to come up with a mechanic spider. My part was to make it move. I had never programmed a robot before. 

I was given a piece of hardware which had a few sensors and four legs.

\section{Goal}
For every project to be succesful a goal needs to be set.
