\section{Intro}

In 2011 I took a course. It was the \textbf{Advanced Topics in Biomechanics} course by \textbf{Adriano Cavalcanti, Ph.D}. During this course we had to come up with various 3D visualizations of different models. I chose to do that within WebGL. As a final task we had to come up with a mechanic spider. My part was to make it move. I had never programmed a robot before. 

I was given a piece of hardware which had a few sensors and four legs.

\section{Goal}
For every project to be succesful a goal needs to be set. 
Avoid obstacles
Go to thee light
Stop when there

In this chapter we shall have a look at how to build on this example on your machine.

\section{Arduino}
Although this document briefly describes Arduino related development it is considered out of scope and is not part of the default \textbf{jsc eXperience}.

At this time jsc does not support any languages that target Arduino platform. As such I had to make use of Arduino programming language. Otherwise I could of had my CSharp code compiled to Arduino. This would of had allowed me to use the same code in the visualization and on the chip.

\subsection{Lessons learned}
While programming for Arduino I had to manually port my code I had written for the visualizer to the Arduino platform. In doing so I discovered that the int is considered to be 16 bits and that I cannot make use of function pointers. To overcome that I had to divide before I did my multiplication. Yes I had to track down an overflow bug before I realized this. The callbacks I used were simple. They only had a few parameters. This allowed me to replace the function pointer with pointer to variable and have the same behaviour of code.




\chapter{The How - Install JSC}

\figpng{Images/jsc_-_Google_Chrome-2012-03-14_14.33.04}
{Download JSC at \url{http://download.jsc-solutions.net}}

Installing JSC is easy. Before you do make sure you have installed Visual Studio 2010 Web Developer Express.
