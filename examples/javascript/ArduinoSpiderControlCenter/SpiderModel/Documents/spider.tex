In 2011 I took a course. It was a course on biomechanics. During this course we had to come up with 3D visualizations of different models. As a final task we had to come up with a mechanic spider. My part was to make it move. I had never programmed a robot before. 

\chapter{What - Create a WebGL Spider}
