      Lets have a virtual console, then stream events from the server.
      Clients shall generate their own id, by which the messages can be stored
      in the database.
    </p>

    <button>check database</button>
    <button>check server for session</button>
    <button>do long operation</button>
    <button>wait in handler</button>

    <hr />
    <p>First lets implement manual console polling.</p>
    <button>Get current id to start listening</button>
    <button>Use current id to get output</button>
    <hr />
    <p>Then lets implement ServerSentEvents.</p>
    <blockquote>Note that some browser may not support that. For example IE 10?</blockquote>
    <button>Start ServerSentEvents</button>
    <button>Stop ServerSentEvents</button>
    <hr />
    <button>Change Session To</button>
    <hr />

    For AppEngine, do we have a flush problem? Server Sent events seem to have a delay until it is closed.

    <h3>EventSource</h3>
    <p>AppEngine does not support flusing. IE does not support it. Android webview does not support it.</p>
