  <h1>The Eleven Guesses</h1>
  <p>Hearing this condition imposed by the Nome King, Ozma became silent and thoughtful, and all her friends looked at her uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don't you do it!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy. &ldquo;If you guess wrong, you will be enslaved yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I shall have eleven guesses,&rdquo; answered Ozma. &ldquo;Surely I ought to guess one object in eleven correctly; and, if I do, I shall rescue on of the royal family and be safe myself. Then the rest of you may attempt it, and soon we shall free all those who are enslaved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What if we fail?&rdquo; enquired the Scarecrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d look nice as a piece of bric-a-brac, wouldn&rsquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must not fail!&rdquo; cried Ozma, courageously. &ldquo;Having come all this distance to free these poor people, it would be weak and cowardly in us to abandon the adventure. Therefore I will accept the Nome King's offer, and go at once into the royal palace.&rdquo;</p>
