This document will show you how this solution was built.

2009.04.29
1. Find an interesting algorithm. We found Mandelbrot.
2. Create .net assembly to implement that assembly.
3. Create a form assembly for basic visualization.
4. The algorithm implementation shall be defined as static.
5. Verify the visulation and commit to svn.
