Good news!

we now have a special folder /examples/vr

In the past we used to have /javascript after which we moved to /examples/javascript
The move is still not complete and we still have pending old examples to be dealt with.

The new /examples/vr folder is for examples of DUALVR project.
Such projects may be javascript, chrome apps, javascript for android, java for android or even ADK.
Future VR apps may include all aspects in a single project, linked by jsc.
