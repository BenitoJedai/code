The only thing i think this needs is a CPU option and powerups like speed.

I hate to say this, but I don't think like Nonoba Racer it will blow up on the internet, but it would be good if you got a group of friends to play, but even that might not be enough to be a good game 2/5

Seriously crap! I don't even get how it works. It's ugly. The mouse pointer just disapears on the game. I rate it zero.

And it has absolutely nothing to do with tower defence. That is just a lame title made up to catch attention.
