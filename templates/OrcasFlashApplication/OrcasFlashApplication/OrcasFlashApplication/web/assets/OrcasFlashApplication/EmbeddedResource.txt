The jsc compiler supports embedded resources.
If you create a new project the new project name will not however be applied to the resource folder.
This is why you will manually need to rename the parent folder of this file to match the project name.

All embedded resources at folder /web/assets/<projectname>/ can be embedded in your flash application.

See other examples in the jsc sdk.
