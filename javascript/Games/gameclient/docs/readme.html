A player is inserted into a random map, where it can move its units around the map.
When he finds others there will be a possibility to join a game, by building or setting a flag.
Each game should be left open so that late comers can also join.

<h1>Generic polling game networking protocol.</h1>
    <p>
        Each client polls periodically the server. On each poll any queued messages will
        be sent and any messages will be recieved. Once the polling stops, the server may
        destroy the session.</p>
    <p>
        Methods which are availible for clients without session or with invalid sessions
        should be marked with an attribute SafeForAnonymousClients.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

<h2>CheckVersion</h2>
If a browser has cached the client application, this will atleast stop the client with a message to clear the cache.

<h2>JoinLobby</h2>
Until this moment the client is considered to be anonymous. This will create its own session. A client with a session may time out and the session will be deleted. An anonymous client cannot receive any server sent messages.

<h2>DisplayText</h2>
Server sends text for the client to be displayed.

<h2>ClientReload</h2>
Forces the clients to reload. This may be used to indicate that the server has been set to work in slave mode, which can invalidate all given sessions.
