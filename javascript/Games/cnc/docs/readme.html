<h1>Lobby</h1>

A player is inserted into a random map, where it can move its units around the map.
When he finds others there will be a possibility to join a game, by building or setting a flag.
Each game should be left open so that late comers can also join.



<h1>Generic polling game networking protocol.</h1>

<h2>CheckVersion</h2>
If a browser has cached the client application, this will atleast stop the client with a message to clear the cache.

<h2>JoinLobby</h2>
Until this moment the client is considered to be anonymous. This will create its own session. A client with a session may time out and the session will be deleted. An anonymous client cannot receive any server sent messages.

<h2>DisplayText</h2>
Server sends text for the client to be displayed.

<h2>ClientReload</h2>
Forces the clients to reload. This may be used to indicate that the server has been set to work in slave mode, which can invalidate all given sessions.
