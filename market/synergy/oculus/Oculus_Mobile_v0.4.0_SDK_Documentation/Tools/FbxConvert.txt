1. OVERVIEW
===========

The FBX converter reads one or more Autodesk FBX files and creates a file
with models stored in JSON format accompanied with a binary file with raw
data. The JSON file created by the FBX converter contains the following:

- A render model. This model has a list of textures, a list of joints, a
  list of tags, and a list of surfaces. Each surface has a material with
  a type and references to the textures used. The material textures may
  include a diffuse, specular, normal, emissive and reflection texture.
  Each surface also has a set of indexed vertices. The vertices may
  include the following attributes: position, normal, tangent, binormal,
  color, uv0, uv1, joint weights, joint indices. Two sets of UVs are
  supported, one set for a diffuse/normal/specular texture and a separate
  set for an optional emissive texture.

- A wall collision model. This model is used to prevent an avatar from
  walking through walls. This is a list of polytopes where each polytope
  is described by a set of planes. The polytopes are not necessarily
  bounded or convex.

- A ground collision model. This model determines the floor height of the
  avatar. This model is also no more than a list of polytopes.

- A ray trace model. This is a triangle soup with a Surface Area Heuristic
  (SAH) optimized KD-tree for fast ray tracing. Meshes or triangles will
  have to be annotated to allow interactive focus tracking or gaze selection.

Textures for the render model can be embedded in an FBX file and will be
extracted by the FBX converter. Embedded textures are extracted into a
folder named <filename>.fbm/, which is a sub-folder of the folder where
the FBX file <filename>.fbx is located. Instead of embedding textures, they
can also simply be stored in the same folder as the FBX file. The following
source texture formats are supported: BMP, TGA, PNG, JPG. For the best
quality, a lossy compression format like JPG should be avoided.

The JSON file with models and the binary file are stored in a temporary
folder named <filename>_tmp/, which is a sub-folder of the folder where
the FBX converter is launched, where <filename> is the output file name
specified with the '-o' command-line option. The FBX converter will also
create a <filename>_pack.bat batch file in the folder where the FBX
converter is launched.

This batch file is used to compress the render model textures to a platform
specific compression format. A texture will be compressed to ETC2 (with or
without alpha) for OpenGL ES mobile platforms and to S3TC (either DXT1/BC1
or DXT5/BC3) for the PC. The batch file uses file time stamps to only
compress textures for which there is not already a compressed version that
is newer than the source texture. The '-clean' command-line option can be
used to force recompression of all textures.

The batch file will also copy the JSON model file, the binary file with
raw data and the platform specific compressed textures into a folder
named <filename>_tmp/pack/, which is a sub-folder of the aforementioned
<filename>_tmp/ folder. 7-Zip is then used to zip up the 'pack' folder
into a single package that can be loaded by the application. The '-pack'
command-line option can be used to automatically execute the
<filename>_pack.bat batch file from the FBX converter.


1.1 COORDINATE SYSTEM
=====================

The Oculus SDK uses the same coordinates system as the default coordinate system
in 3D Studio Max or Luxology Modo. This is a right handed coordinate system
with:

+X = right
-X = left
+Y = up
-Y = down
+Z = backward
-Z = forward

The Oculus SDK uses the metric system for measurements, where one unit is
equal to one meter. 3D Studio Max and Luxology Modo do not use any specific
unit of measure, but one unit in either application maps to one unit in the
Oculus SDK. However, when the data from Luxology Modo is saved to an FBX file
all units are automatically multiplied by one hundred. In other words, the
unit of measure in the FBX file ends up being centimeter. Therefore there
is always a scale of 1/100 specified on the FBX converter command-line when
converting FBX files from Luxology Modo: -scale 0.01

The FBX converter supports several command-line options to transform the FBX
geometry (translate, rotate, scale etc.). The transformations will be applied
to the geometry in the order they are listed on the command-line.


1.2 MATERIALS
=============

Each render model surface stored in the JSON models file has a material.
Such a material has a type and references to the textures used. The
material textures may include a diffuse, specular, normal, emissive and
reflection texture. These textures are retrieved from the FBX file as:

    'DiffuseColor'
    'NormalMap'
    'SpecularColor'
    'EmissiveColor'
    'ReflectionColor'

Most modeling tools will map similarly named textures to the above textures
in the FBX file. For instance, using Luxology Modo, the 'Emissive color'
texture is mapped to the 'EmissiveColor' texture in the FBX file.

During rendering the diffuse texture is multiplied with the emissive
texture as follows:

	color = DiffuseColor(uv0) * EmissiveColor(uv1) * 1.5

Surface reflections look into a cube map (or environment map). The
textures for the 6 cube map sides should be named:

    <name>_right.<ext>
    <name>_left.<ext>
    <name>_up.<ext>
    <name>_down.<ext>
    <name>_backward.<ext>
    <name>_forward.<ext>

The reflection texture 'ReflectionColor' should be set to one of these
6 textures used to create the cube map. The FBX converter automatically
picks up the other 5 textures and combines all 6 textures into a cube map.
The normal map that is used to calculate the surface reflection is expected
to be in local (tangent) space. During rendering the color of reflection
mapped materials is calculated as follows:

    surfaceNormal = normalize( NormalMap(uv0).x * tangent +
                               NormalMap(uv0).y * binormal +
                               NormalMap(uv0).z * normal )
    reflection = dot( eyeVector, surfaceNormal ) * 2.0 * surfaceNormal - eyeVector
    color = DiffuseColor(uv0) * EmissiveColor(uv1) * 1.5 +
            SpecularColor(uv0) * ReflectionColor(reflection)

The material type is one of the following:

    1. opaque
    2. perforated
    3. transparent
    4. additive

The first three material types are based on the alpha channel of the
diffuse texture. The '-alpha' command-line option must be used to enable
the 'perforated' and 'transparent' material types. Without the '-alpha'
command-line option the alpha channel of the diffuse texture will be
removed.

The 'additive' material type cannot be derived from the textures.
An additive texture is specified by appending '_additive' to the
material name in the FBX file.


1.3 ANIMATIONS
==============

There is currently not a full blown animation system, but having vertices
weighted to joints is still very useful to programmatically move geometry,
while rendering as few surfaces as possible. Think about things like the
buttons and joystick on the arcade machines in VrArcade.

An artist can setup the vertex weighting for skinning, but the FBX converter
also has an option to rigidly bind the vertices of a FBX source mesh to a
single joint. In this case the joint name will be the name of the FBX source
mesh. The meshes that need to be rigidly skinned to a joint are specified
using the '-skin' command-line option. There is currently a limit of 16 joints
per FBX file.

The FBX converter can also apply some very basic parametric animations to joints.
These simple animations are specified using the '-anim' command-line option.
The types of animation are 'rotate', 'sway' and 'bob'. One of these types is
specified directly following the '-anim' command-line option. Several parameters
that define the animation are specified after the type. For the 'rotate' and
'sway' these parameters are 'pitch', 'yaw' and 'roll' in degrees per second.
For the 'bob' the parameters are 'x', 'y' and 'z' in meters per second.
Following these parameters, a time offset and scale can be specified. The
time offset is typically use to animated multiple joints out of sync and
the time scale can be used to speed up or slow down the animation. Last but
not least, one or more joints are specified to which the animation should
be applied.

When a mesh is rigidly skinned to a joint using the '-skin' command-line option,
the FBX converter stores the mesh node transform on the joint. This mesh node
transform is used as the frame of reference (pivot and axes) for animations.


1.4 TAGS
========

A tag is used to define a position and frame of reference in the world.
A tag can, for instance, be used to to define a screen or a view position
in a cinema. A tag can also be used to place objects in the world.

The '-tag' command-line option is used to turn one or more FBX meshes from
the render model into tags. The name of a tag will be the name of the mesh.
The position and frame of reference are derived from the first triangle of
the mesh and are stored in a 4x4 matrix. The position is the corner of the
triangle that is most orthogonal. The edges that come out of this corner
define the first two basis vectors of the frame of reference. These basis
vectors are not normalized to maintain the dimensions of the frame. The
third basis vector is the triangle normal vector.

Multiple tags can be created by specifying multiple FBX mesh names after
the '-tag' command-line option. The '-tag' command-line option does not
remove the listed meshes from the render model. The '-remove' command-line
option can be used to remove the meshes from the render model.


2. COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE
=========================

The FBX converter is a command-line tool. To run the FBX converter open a
Windows Command Prompt, which can be found in the Windows Start menu under
"All Programs" -> "Accessories". A command prompt can also be opened by
typing 'cmd' (without quotes) in the Windows Run prompt in the Start menu.
Once a command prompt has been opened, it is recommended to launch the FBX
converter from the folder where the source FBX files are located.

The FBX converter comes with the following tools:

FbxConvertx64.exe   (from Oculus VR)
TimeStampx64.exe    (from Oculus VR)
PVRTexTool/*        (version 3.4, from the PowerVR SDK version 3.3)
7Zip/*              (version 9.20, from www.7-zip.org)

The FbxConvert64.exe is the executable that is launched by the user. The
other executables are directly or indirectly used by the FbxConvertx64.exe
executable.

The '-collision', '-ground' and '-raytrace' command-line options can either
specify a separate FBX file, or they can specify a list of meshes from the
FBX file specified with the '-render' command-line option. If the collision
and ray-trace meshes are in the same FBX file as the to be rendered meshes
but the collision and ray-trace surface should not be rendered, then these
meshes can be removed for rendering using the '-remove' command-line option.

Note that the '-collision', '-ground', '-raytrace', '-remove', '-atlas',
'-discrete', '-skin' and '-tag' command-line options accept wild cards
like '*' and '?'. For instance, to make all surfaces discrete use:
'-discrete *'.


2.2 BATCH EXECUTION
===================

Instead of typing all the command-line options on the command prompt, it is
common practice to use a batch file to launch the FBX converter with a number
of options. This allows for quick iteration on the assets while consistently
using the same settings. The following is the contents of the batch file that
was used to convert the FBX for the home theater:

FbxConvertx64.exe -o home_theater -pack -stripModoNumbers -rotate 180 -scale 0.01 -translate 0.45 0 -3 -swapxz -flipv -sort origin -tag screen -render home_theater\home_theater.fbx -raytrace screen


2.3 TROUBLESHOOTING
===================

The FBX converter prints several things on the screen such as configuration
options and warnings and errors. Warnings (like missing textures etc.) are
printed in yellow, and errors (like missing executables) are printed in red.


3. OPTIMIZATION
===============

The FBX converter implements various command-line options that can be used
to optimize the geometry for rendering.


3.1 REDUCING DRAW CALLS
=======================

The FBX converter automatically merges FBX meshes that use the same material
such that they will be rendered as a single surface. At some point it may
become necessary to automatically break up surfaces for culling granularity.
However, currently it is more important to reduce the number of draw calls
due to significant driver overhead on mobile platforms. Source meshes that
need to stay separate for some reason can be flagged using the '-discrete'
command-line option of the FBX converter.

To further reduce the number of draw calls, or to statically sort all geometry
into a single surface, the FBX converter can also create one of more texture
atlases using the '-atlas' option. This option takes a list of FBX source
meshes that need to have their textures combined into an atlas. Multiple
atlases can be created by specifying the '-atlas' command-line option
multiple times with different mesh names. Textures that are placed in an
atlas cannot be tiled (repeated) on a mesh and the texture coordinates
of the source mesh need to all be in the [0, 1] range.


3.2 REDUCING VERTICES
=====================

During conversion, the FBX converter displays the total number of triangles
and the total number of vertices of the render geometry. The number of
vertices is expected to be in the same ballpark as the number of triangles.
Having over two times more vertices than triangles may have performance
implications. The number of unique vertices can be reduced by removing
vertex attributes that are not necessary for rendering. Unused vertex
attributes are generally wasteful and removing them may increase
rendering performance just by improving GPU vertex cache usage.

An FBX file may store vertex attributes that are not used for rendering.
For instance, vertex normals may be stored in the FBX file, but they will
not be used for rendering unless there is some form of specular lighting.
The FBX file may also store a second set of texture coordinates that are
not used when there are no emissive textures. The '-attrib' command-line
option of the FBX converter can be used to keep only those attributes that
are necessary to correctly render the model. For instance, if the model
only renders a diffuse texture with baked lighting then all unnecessary
vertex attributes can be removed by using '-attrib position uv0'.

The '-attrib' command-line option also accepts the 'auto' keyword. By using
the 'auto' keyword the FBX converter will automatically determine which
vertex attributes need to be kept based on the textures specified per
surface material. The 'auto' keyword can be specified in combination with
other vertex attributes. For instance: '-attrib auto color' will make sure
that the color attribute will always be kept and the other vertex attributes
will only be kept if they are needed to correctly render based on the
specified textures. The following table shows how the FBX converter
determines which attributes to keep when the 'auto' keyword is specified:

    position:   always automatically kept
    normal:     if 'NormalMap' or 'SpecularColor' texture is specified
    tangent:    if 'NormalMap' texture is specified
    binormal:   if 'NormalMap' texture is specified
    uv0:        if 'DiffuseColor' or 'SpecularColor' texture is specified
    uv1:        if 'EmissiveColor' texture is specified
    color:      never automatically kept


3.3 REDUCING OVERDRAW
=====================

To be able to render many triangles, it is important to minimize overdraw
as much as possible. For scenes or models that do have overdraw, it is very
important that the opaque geometry is rendered front-to-back to significantly
reduce the number of shading operations. Scenes or models that will only be
displayed from a single viewpoint, or a limited range of view points, can be
statically sorted to guarantee front-to-back rendering on a per triangle basis.

The FBX converter has a '-sort' command-line option to statically sort all
the geometry. The '-sort' option first sorts all the vertices. Then it sorts
all the triangles based on the smallest vertex index. Next to sorting all
the triangles this also results in improved GPU vertex cache usage.

The '-sort' option can sort all geometry along one of the coordinate axes
or it can sort all geometry from the origin. Sorting along an axis is useful
for diorama-like scenes. Sorting from the origin is useful for theater-like
scenes with a full 360 view.

Sorting along an axis is done by specifying + or - one of the coordinate
axis (X, Y or Z). For instance, to sort all geometry front-to-back along
the X axis use:

	-sort +X

Sorting from the origin can be done by specifying + or - origin. For instance,
to sort all geometry front-to-back from the origin use:

	-sort +origin

For sorting from the origin to be effective, the origin of the FBX model
or scene must be the point from which the model or scene will be viewed.
Keep in mind that sorting from the origin happens after any translations
have been applied to the FBX geometry using the '-translate' command-line
option. In other words, when using the '-sort +origin' command-line option
in combination with the '-translate' option, the scene will be sorted from
the translated position instead of the original FBX origin.

Scenes that can be viewed from multiple vantage points may need to be
manually broken up into reasonably sized blocks of geometry that will
be dynamically sorted front-to-back at run-time. If the meshes the scene
is broken up into use the same material, then the '-discrete' command-line
option can be used to keep the meshes separate for rendering.
